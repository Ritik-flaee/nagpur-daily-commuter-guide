## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### How Kiro Accelerated This Project

**Traditional approach (2-3 weeks):**
1. Research traffic patterns (5 days)
2. Build database (3 days)
3. API development (3 days)
4. UI development (3 days)
5. Testing & refinement (2 days)

**Kiro approach (4 days):**
1. Write product.md (1 day) - Curate knowledge
2. Kiro understands it (instant) - Learns expertise
3. Build Streamlit UI (0.5 days) - Simple interface
4. Testing & refinement (1.5 days) - Polish

**The acceleration:** Kiro generated response logic from context instead of hardcoding, reducing development by 75%.

### Why product.md is Special

**Traditional:** AI learns from massive datasets, data varies, must use APIs
**This approach:** AI learns from curated documentation, knowledge is consistent, no external dependencies

**Advantage:** Transparent, auditable, maintainable, faster development.
